Replace FUDATE with the follow-up date in mm/dd/yyyy format, if reported; replace FUDATE with null if not reported.
Note that if size is in cm, convert it to mm.
If there is only one size number of a nodule, use this size as average diameter (ADIA) in mm, and keep the other diameters, including LAXIS, SAXIS, TAXIS, as null.
If there are two size numbers, such as 3x4 mm, then set LAXIS to 4, set SAXIS to 3, set ADIA to 3.5, and set TAXIS to null.
If you cannot approximate the size of a nodule from the description, such as micronodule, subcentimeter, etc., replace all sizes with null.
If there is a number to describe the nodule size, such as "less than 0.3 cm", then set ADIA to 3 for an approximation.
Note that if there are more than one size numbers for solid component, calculate the average diameter as the value of PSDIA, such as "with 21 x 10 mm solid component", set PSDIA to 15.5.
Nodules reported in different images are regarded as different nodules.
Note that calcified granulomas are calcified nodules, set TYPE to calcified.
If there are x/y in the report, usually the smaller number between x and y represents the series number and the larger number represents the image number.
For the format "x series y", such as, "98 series 2" or "(41 series 2)", then set SID to y and set IID to x.
If there is no nodule observed, do not include "nodules" and return {"num_nodule": 0, "overall_lung_rads": "LRADSALL", "management_recommendations": "RECOMMEND", "follow_up_date": "FUDATE"}.
For "bilateral nodules" without other specific location information, use one nodule dictionary and set LUNG to "bilateral".
When "additional pulmonary nodules", "additional micronodules", "A few additional scattered pulmonary micronodules", "Numerous bilateral calcified pulmonary micronodules", or " Similar scattered micronodules" are reported, if individual nodules cannot be distinguished, use one nodule dictionary to represent these nodules.
Annual screening, such as "Continue annual screening with low dose chest CT" and "Consider ongoing annual lung cancer screening", set RECOMMEND to "12-month screening LDCT".
When the nodule is described with "unchanged", "similar", "Similar-appearing", or "minimal change", then set STATUS to stable.
"apex" means upper lobe and the segment of "apical".
When left middle lobe is reported, replace LOBE with lingula.
When aspect is reported, such as "lateral aspect right upper lobe", then set SEG to lateral.
When the nodule or lesion type is not mentioned, such as "Spiculated 2.9 cm left upper lobe lesion extending to the pleura.", then replace TYPE with null, and replace MARGIN with spiculated.
When the margin is not explicitly reported, such as "Spiculated	No" which means it is not spiculated, then replace MARGIN with null.
If the lobe information is not complete, such as "posterior segment right lobe" or "subpleural superior segment right lobe", then replace LOBE with null.
Do not count the nodule reported in the "MEDIASTINUM/HILUM/AXILLA".
Do not count nodular density as a lung nodule, such as "Nodular density in a right lower lobe segmental bronchiole, series 2 image 262.", this is not a nodule.
When the previous lung nodule is "no longer clearly evident", "resolved", or "largely resolved", then count it as a lung nodule and set STATUS to resolved.
Note that if interval development is reported, such as "Interval development of bilobed nodule", set STATUS to "interval development".
When multiple nodules can be distinguished from the descriptions, multiple nodule dictionaries should be created. For example, "Right middle lobe perifissural, 2 nodules, anterior subpleural and perihilar, image 176" means there are 2 nodules on image 176 and NUM adds 2, i.e., if there are 8 other nodules, NUM now is 8+2=10. Then, 2 nodule dictionaries will be created for this description: one is for the nodule located at "anterior" segment and "subpleural", and the other is for the nodule located at "perihilar".
If there are multiple comparison dates in the section of COMPARISON, use the latest comparison date as CDATE; if there is a specific comparison date for an individual nodule, use the nodule-specific comparison date.
If bronchoscopy is mentioned in the Management Recommendation part, set RECOIMAGING to tissue sampling.
Note that do not miss the imaging recommendations, for example, "CT PET" mean "PET/CT", "Consider tissue sampling versus continued surveillance with repeat low dose chest CT in 3-6 months" means "LDCT, Tissue Sampling", "recommend further evaluation with PET scan, tissue sampling, and/or short-term follow-up low-dose CT" means "LDCT, PET/CT, Tissue sampling".
Note that convert the date to the format "mm/dd/yyyy", such as, convert "2020-Dec-19" to "12/19/2020".
Note that do not miss the calcified granulomas, such as "Scattered calcified granulomas", create a nodule dictionary for this calcified lung nodule.
Note that if the nodule defining the lung RADS category is reported, remember to set LRADS of this lung nodule to the right lung RADS category.
Note that if multiple images are reported, regard each image as a nodule; for example, in the case of "There are bilateral calcified granulomas on series 202 images 45, 82, 124, and 155. There is a 16 x 10 mm RIGHT upper lobe nodule with spiculated margins (202:98). There is an adjacent 7 mm medial subpleural nodule (202:92). There is 5 mm subpleural LEFT lower lobe groundglass nodule (202:228)", 7 nodule dictionaries need to be created; in the case of "Scattered pulmonary micronodules, for example measuring 4 mm the subpleural left lower lobe (series 4, image 379 and 368), 3 to 4 mm along left major fissure (images 245 and 249), 3 mm in the anterior right upper lobe (image 236), 4 mm the right upper lobe (image 280), unchanged. No new or enlarging pulmonary nodules.", 6 nodule dictionaries need to be created; in the case of "There are scattered solid pulmonary nodules present, the largest in the RIGHT upper lobe measuring 3 mm (3:60, 71, 94, 344, 377, 509).", 6 nodule dictionaries need to be created, where the series number is 3.
Note that do not index nodule ids by yourself.
Note that strictly use the predefined options.
